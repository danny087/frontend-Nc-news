My northcoders news application.

Check out the latest articles about topics like coding, football and cooking. Vote on your best articles and comments and even write a article and comment of your own.

This is the front-end for my NC-news project. When interacting  with it, it sends requests to my back-end API and updates the database when you create or vote on a new article and comment.

This application was developed by me to get to grips with everything I learnt when on the Front-end side of the course at   Northcoders.
